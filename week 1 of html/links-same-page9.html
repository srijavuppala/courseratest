    		owledge and understanding one has of the dangers and threats of social
engineering each consumer and business can have and the more each
attack scenario is dissected, the easier it will be to protect from, mitigate,
and stop these attacks. That is where the power of all this knowledge

    	<p>

This book takes a “tell and show approach” by first presenting a principle
behind a topic then defining, explaining, and dissecting, then showing its
application using collections of real stories or case studies. This is not
merely a book about stories or neat tricks, but a handbook, a guide through
the darkworld of social engineering.

    		Throughout the book you can find many Internet links to stories or
accounts as well as links to tools and other aspects of the topics discussed.
Practical exercises appear throughout the book that are designed to help you
master not only the social engineering framework but also the skills to
enhance your dailycommunications.

    	These statements are especially true if you are a security specialist. As
you read this book, I hope to impress upon you that security is not a “parttime” job and is not something to take lightly. As criminals and malicious
social engineers seem to go from bad to worse in this world, attacks on
businesses and personal lives seem to get more intense. Naturally,
everyone wants to be protected, as evidenced by the increase in sales for
personal protection software and devices. Although these items are
important, the best protection is knowledge: security through education. The
onlytrue wayto reduce the effect of these attacks is to know that theyexist, to
know how they are done, and to understand the thinking process and
mentalityof the people who would do suchckers think.
